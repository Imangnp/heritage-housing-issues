        f"visualization and prediction of house prices in Ames, Iowa.\n\n"
        f"The app offers users the following functionalities:\n"
        f"* **Correlation Analysis:** The application allows users to identify the"
        f"correlation between house attributes and the sale price.\n"
        f"* **Sale Price Prediction:** The application provides a predictive model"

        f" floor area, basement and garage.\n"
        f" * **Target Variable**: The target variable in this study is the "
        f"'SalePrice'. It represents the price at which a house was sold.\n\n"

        f"* The dataset consists of properties that were sold in Ames, Iowa. "
        f"It contains details about 24 distinct features for each property,"
        f"which have the potential to impact the price. These features "
        f"encompass various aspects of the houses, including floor area, "
        f"basement, garage, kitchen and year built. We utilize this dataset "
        f"to conduct our study on correlated features, train our machine "
        f"learning model, and subsequently predict the sale prices of "
        f"properties in the area.\n"
        f"* The dataset encompasses houses constructed from 1872 to 2010, and "
        f"it has been obtained from "
        f"[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data)"
